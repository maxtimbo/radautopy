# radautopy

### Requirements

`radautopy` assumes that `ffmpeg` and `rclone` is installed on your system. See [more about rclone](https://rclone.org/). `radautopy` has been tested against a NextCloud provider using `rclone`.

### Installation

Install required packages:

```
$ sudo apt install rclone ffmpeg -y

```

Install `radautopy`:

`pip install radautopy`


### Initial Setup

`radautopy` ships with no configuration files by default. You can choose to write them by hand, or use `radautopy modify --[ftp | rclone | http] {some_new_config}.json edit`. For example:

`$ radautopy modify --ftp MyCoolShow.json edit`

This will create the directories for configs as well as logs at `~/radautopy/config` and `~/radautopy/logs`.

Initially, a global email config will be created at `~/radautopy/config/email.json`.
